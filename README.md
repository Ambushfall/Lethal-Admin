# Lethal Admin
An admin tool for lethal company.

## Installation
Download the LethalAdmin.dll from the releases page. Paste the dll into ``path_to_lethal_company/BepInEx/Plugins``

## Kicking and banning
The mod overrides the kick/ban system.
When kick the player is able to rejoin, but when banning the player is unable to rejoin. 
You can unban a player in the Bans tab by clicking the unban button for that player

## Radio
To prevent radio spam, you can view who is talking on the radio with the toggle to the right of the kick/ban button.

## Actions
You can toggle the lights switch of the ship using a button in the admin pannel.

## Planned
 - Persistent bans (bans will be kept between sessions, instead of resetting after rebooting the game)
 - Send ship from admin pannel
 - Log who voted for early autopilot
