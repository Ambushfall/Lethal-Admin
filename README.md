# Lethal Admin
An admin tool for lethal company.

## Manual Installation
Download the ``LethalAdmin.dll`` and paste the dll into ``path_to_lethal_company/BepInEx/Plugins``

## Kicking and banning
The mod overrides the kick/ban system.
When kick the player is able to rejoin, but when banning the player is unable to rejoin. 
You can unban a player in the Bans tab by clicking the unban button for that player.
Your bans will be saved to the config, meaning that after a reboot of the game, the players you have banned will remain banned.
After a reboot you can still unban the player, _but_ only their steamID is stored, meaning their username will now be displayed as "UNKNOWN".

## Radio
To prevent radio spam, you can view who is talking on the radio with the toggle to the right of the kick/ban button.

## Actions
You can toggle the lights switch of the ship using a button in the admin pannel.
